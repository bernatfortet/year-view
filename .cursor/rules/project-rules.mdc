  React Components

- When creating a component I like to use a function. Destructure the props inside of the function not in the args.
- **Prefer components over render functions**: Instead of `renderFoo()` functions, create proper `<Foo />` components with props. This follows React patterns and improves reusability.
- **Component naming**: Use PascalCase for component names (e.g., `AirtableConnection`, not `renderAirtableConnection`)
- **Move components outside**: Define components outside the main component, not as inner functions

### Layout Components

- Use `<Row>` and `<Column>` components from `@/styles` for flex containers instead of plain `<div>` with flex classes
- `<Row>` = `flex flex-row`, `<Column>` = `flex flex-col`, `<Grid>` = `grid`
- This improves readability and consistency across the codebase
- Example: `<Row className="items-center gap-2">` instead of `<div className="flex flex-row items-center gap-2">`
