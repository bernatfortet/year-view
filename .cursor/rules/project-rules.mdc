### Testing

- most likely I will be using vitest
  React Components

- When creating a component I like to use a function. Destructure the props inside of the function not in the args.
- **Prefer components over render functions**: Instead of `renderFoo()` functions, create proper `<Foo />` components with props. This follows React patterns and improves reusability.
- **Component naming**: Use PascalCase for component names (e.g., `AirtableConnection`, not `renderAirtableConnection`)
- **Move components outside**: Define components outside the main component, not as inner functions
