# React Code Rules

- We're using React 19 with compiler on, so no need to useMemo unless super important (very expensive calculations that we want to have control over)
- NEVER USE React.memo. NEVER EVER

#### Components

- When a component has event functions, if that funciton doesn't require state (it's more pure) add it outside and below of the component function. This whay the separation is clearer

- **useEffectEvent**: Use to extract non-reactive logic from Effects. Call only inside Effects (useEffect, useLayoutEffect, useInsertionEffect). Use when you need to read the latest props/state without making them reactive dependencies. Do NOT use as a dependency shortcut—prefer explicit dependencies when values should trigger re-runs.
