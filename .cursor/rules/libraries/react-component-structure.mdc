### Component Structure

- Keep component bodies focused on rendering. Move non-trivial logic outside the main component function.
- Use small, single-responsibility functions. Order functions top-to-bottom by call hierarchy (higher-level first, helpers last).
- Prefer named React components. No default exports.
- Use object parameters for functions with more than 2 params. Destructure on the next line.
- Use early returns and optional chaining to avoid undefined access.
- If you want to create a div/layer/container with flex col or row, make sure to use <Column> or <Row> by importing from `import { Column, Row } from '~/styles'` . Row has flex row, and Column has flex col
- Use {ifTrue && <MyCmop>} instead of {ifTrue ? <MyComp > : null}

### Co-location & File Size

- If a logic block (hook, data preparation, transformation, or fetching) exceeds ~50 lines, move it into a colocated file next to the consumer.
- Naming conventions:
  - Hooks: `use-thing.ts`
  - Server helpers: `thing.server.ts` (or inside `server-actions`)
  - Client stores: `thing.store.ts`
- Keep types that are only used by a function just above that function. Do not export them unless needed elsewhere.

### Consistency & Quality

- Avoid derived state when possible; compute values in render or memoize at the source.
- Ensure reference stability for arrays/objects returned from hooks.
- Do not introduce new global state without review. Prefer React patterns.
- Follow existing logging style with concise, contextual messages (emoji prefixes allowed: 🏁, 🌀, 💾, ✅, 🚨, ❌/🗑️).

### Small Helper Functions

- Define small, pure helpers (e.g., URL builders, formatters) outside component bodies. Do not create them inline inside components.
- Prefer colocating helpers in the same file below components or in dedicated `*-utils.ts` files if reused across modules.
- Components should call helpers directly rather than receive them via props.

### Testing Workflow

- Before modifying logic that has tests, run tests first. After edits, run them again and ensure they pass.
- When creating new utilities/hooks, add focused tests that cover edge cases and errors.
