Review this plan as a council of senior engineers. Evaluate:

- Is this solving the root cause or just a symptom?
- Is there a higher level in the code where changes would be more meaningful?
- Could this cause regressions? What are the implications?
- Are we duplicating code or patterns that already exist?
- Are we organizing code properly? separation of concerns and decoupling? the right separation of files and folders?
- Does the code flow make sense?
- What could be improved?

Ask clarifying questions if anything is unclear. Finish with clear recommendations.
